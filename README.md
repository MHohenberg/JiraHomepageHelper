# Jira Homepage Helper

This is a small HTML page I as a Jira Server administrator use as the homepage
of my browser. 
It should work just as well for Data Center installations.
It helps me quickly access functionality I use a lot, without having to click
through menues or enter text in the gg console. 
It also allows for a quick conversion between Jira-compatible markup language
and SIL Templates. 
The page is fully configurable. 

## Setup

Follow the instructions in the HTML file
